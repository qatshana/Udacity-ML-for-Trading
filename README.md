# Udacity-ML-for-Trading
Several projects for my work on Udacity Class - Machine Learning for Trading

I have worked on serval projects

# 1) Load Stock Prices and Analyze Peformance
We load serval stock prices from csv files into pandas dataframe format and analyze/plot results

# 2) Show Portfolio Stats

Based on certain allocation in terms of % and stock tickers, we analyze perforamnce of portfolio over certain dates as defined by the user and
present performance statisically and through graphics
